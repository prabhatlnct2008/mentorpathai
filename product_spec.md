1. Name that screams MENTORING

Primary name

Name: MentorPath AI
Tagline: 1:1 GenAI mentoring to ship your first AI product.

Why it works:
	•	Mentor → they immediately know it’s about guidance, not just content
	•	Path → journey, roadmap, not a random set of tips
	•	AI → clear what domain you mentor in

You’ll use this in your copy like:

“MentorPath AI pairs you with a 1:1 mentor to help you ship your first AI product in around 6 weeks – even if you’re not a coder.”

(If you want backups later, we can brainstorm; but let’s build around MentorPath AI now.)

3. Chat-First Landing – Conversation Flow & Copy

Think of this as your entire landing page living inside a chat. I’ll write it as:
	•	Mentor: bubble content
	•	User options / actions: buttons or form

Step 0 – Above-the-fold layout

Before the chat:
	•	Top of page (outside chat):
	•	Tiny capsule:
NEW • 1:1 GenAI Mentoring Program
	•	Page title (outside chat, small):
MentorPath AI
Build your first AI product in ~6 weeks with a personal mentor.

Under that: the big chat card.

⸻

Step 1 – Opening hook

Mentor bubble 1:

👋 Hey, I’m your GenAI mentor from MentorPath AI.

Do you want help building your first AI product using ChatGPT, Claude, RAG and vibe-coding – even if you’re not a coder?

User choices (buttons):
	•	Yes, that’s exactly what I want
	•	I’m just exploring for now

Clicking either still continues, but you can track which one for segmentation.

⸻

Step 2 – Persona selection

Mentor bubble 2 (after click):

Awesome. Quick question so I don’t waste your time – which one sounds most like you?

User choice buttons (3–4 large pills):
	•	Non-technical founder with an idea
	•	Laid-off or worried about AI replacing my role
	•	In a non-tech role (PM, ops, marketing, etc.)
	•	Student / career switcher

(When they click, store this as persona in your lead.)

⸻

Step 3 – Mirror back who they are (empathy)

Mentor bubble 3 (dynamic text – insert persona label):

Got it.

I work with a lot of [non-technical founders / laid-off folks / non-tech professionals / students] who feel stuck.

They don’t want to become full-time engineers – they just want to use AI to build something real and open new doors.

Follow-up message:

That’s exactly what MentorPath AI is for:
1:1 mentoring + work-hours support to help you ship an AI project in ~6 weeks.

⸻

Step 4 – Show outcomes as rich cards

Mentor bubble 4:

Here’s what you’ll be able to do by the end of the program:

Inside this “message”, show 3 horizontally scrollable cards:

Card 1 – Build a real AI product

Build a real AI product
Turn your idea into something concrete: a chatbot on your data, an internal AI assistant, or a small SaaS tool you can demo.

Card 2 – Use RAG on your own data

Use RAG on your own data
Learn how to plug in PDFs, Notion docs or databases so your AI actually knows your world, not just the public internet.

Card 3 – Vibe-code with confidence

Vibe-code with confidence
Learn to describe what you want in English and let tools like ChatGPT + Cursor write code – while understanding enough to debug and tweak it.

Under the cards (still inside the “message”):

Want me to send you the full program breakdown and early-bird details?

User button:
	•	Yes, send me the details

⸻

Step 5 – Email capture inside chat

(When they click the “Yes” button, show a form bubble.)

Mentor bubble 5:

Perfect. Drop your email and I’ll send you:
– The 6-week structure
– Example projects you could build
– Early-bird pricing for the first cohorts

Embedded form in the chat:
	•	Label: Your email
	•	Input placeholder: you@example.com
	•	Optional dropdown: “What best describes you?” (pre-filled from earlier if possible)

Button inside bubble:
	•	Get program details in my inbox

⸻

Step 6 – Success response & next steps

Mentor bubble 6 (on successful submit):

✅ You’re on the MentorPath AI early access list.

Check your inbox in the next few minutes – I’ll send you:
– The detailed curriculum
– Example AI projects tailored to your background
– How to apply for the 1:1 mentoring cohorts

Then, follow up with “optional reading” bubbles for those who keep scrolling.

⸻

4. Deeper Info as Further Chat Messages

Now that email is captured, we can continue the “landing page” content in chat form.

4.1 “How the mentoring works”

Mentor bubble 7:

Want a quick overview of how the mentoring actually works?

Buttons:
	•	Yes, show me
	•	I’ll read it in the email later

If they click “Yes”:

Mentor bubble 8:

Here’s the TL;DR of the program:

• ~6 weeks, part-time, fully online
• 1× 60–90 min 1:1 live session per week
• Work-hours support on Slack/WhatsApp when you’re stuck
• You work on your own AI project the entire time

Mentor bubble 9:

Each week, we move you along a clear path:

1️⃣ Clarify your idea & set up your tools
2️⃣ Build the first working AI feature (with ChatGPT / Claude)
3️⃣ Add your own data using RAG
4️⃣ Vibe-code the UI / workflow
5️⃣ Test, debug, refine
6️⃣ Prepare your demo / launch plan

Add a tiny CTA:
	•	Sounds good – keep me posted about cohorts

(Just an acknowledgement; no extra form.)

⸻

4.2 Friendly FAQ in chat

Mentor bubble 10:

A few questions people usually ask:

Then 3 “expandable” FAQ lines (or stacked bubbles):
	1.	“Do I need to know how to code?”
Not really. We assume you’re near zero. You’ll learn just enough to understand and control what the AI tools are generating.
	2.	“Can I do this while working full-time?”
Yes. Most people do 1 live session + 3–4 hours of practice per week. We design around busy schedules.
	3.	“Is this a bootcamp?”
No. This is 1:1 mentoring. Think of it like a personal trainer – but for AI skills and your own project.

End with a soft CTA:

Mentor bubble 11:

If you change your mind later or want to invite a friend, just reply to the email I send you – we read every reply.

5. Functional Notes for Dev

You can hand this to dev/yourself as implementation hints:

5.1 Chat page behavior
	•	The “chat” is scripted, not a real model:
	•	Each click reveals the next pre-defined bubble(s).
	•	All branching choices eventually converge to the same email form.
	•	After email submission, store:
	•	email
	•	persona (from Step 2)
	•	Maybe source = landing_chat

5.2 Email integration
	•	POST /api/leads from the chat form.
	•	On backend:
	•	Save to DB / Google Sheets / CRM.
	•	Trigger welcome email with:
	•	Subject: “Welcome to MentorPath AI – here’s your 6-week GenAI mentoring overview”

5.3 Fallback for non-clickers / SEO
	•	Below the chat card, you can still place a collapsed FAQ section and a static email form:
	•	For SEO content indexing
	•	For people who scroll without interacting
